Responsive Design:
For the responsive design, the best I did was the margins around elements in the webpage. As well as have zoom in and highlights on some elements in the webpage.

Navigation:
I've set up a navigation menu featuring links to different sections like 'About Me', and 'Interests'. The idea is to make the navigation visually engaging, and you'll notice some neat hover effects to enhance the user interface.

Styling:
In terms of styling, I've played around with background patterns, images, transitions, and hover effects. These elements contribute to the overall visual appeal of the website.

JavaScript Interaction:
I've linked an external JavaScript file in the HTML (jsMain.js), which is mainly to control how the moving background's location isn't reset immediately.

External Libraries:
For the font, I've opted for Google Fonts to bring in 'Roboto,' contributing to the overall design aesthetics.

Creative Elements:
To inject a creative touch, I've incorporated background patterns, images, hover effects, a loading screen, and even a parallax effect in the background patterns. These elements are designed to enhance the overall user experience.

GitHub Deployment:
For hosting, I've chosen GitHub as the platform. It provides an accessible and version-controlled environment for deploying the website.

Content:
Within the HTML structure, you'll find sections for 'About Me' and 'Interests.' Currently, the content is placeholder text, but the idea is to add more details and personalize it for a more engaging experience.

Inspiration for Design:
The design inspiration revolves around achieving a modern and visually appealing style, although I haven't explicitly mentioned specific sources of inspiration.

Insights:
Of the many things I've learned, most of which are new, it's that there are too many ways for one to do something without planning properly. Another is that a lot of research is needed in order to find the right way to handle a task in a manner that is satisfactory to me.

Struggles:
For the struggles oh boy there was a TON. Firstly, as I've mentioned before, a lot of hours of my time went into researching and discovering/finding new ideas, tricks, concepts, and designs for my webpage. 
There were a lot of times wherein one specific task kept me up late at night, leaving me scratching my head as why the task looks deceptively simple and yet actuallly hard if you're looking at it the wrong way or if you haven't yet uncovered a trick other people use to solve it. From how to put the sliding picture in the container and actually making them slide in their proper position, to figuring out the proper dimensions needed for everything to fit. That isn't even including the pain of designing the webpage and then having to scrap it and redo it since it doesn't look all that appealing. For the guided exercises I guess the same problem applies here, a LOT of research is needed.

Improvements:
A whole bunch of improvements can be made to make it better. One of which might be that I never did find a suitable way to present my about me page. It's been through too many iterations to list down so in the end it looks a little lackluster. Next improvement would be my image slider, I kind of didn't completely understand the math on how to properly make each image always fit the screen but I guess I would take note of that in the future. 

Other Thoughts:
My other thoughts would be to probably make something a little more easier and minimalistic. As those types of websites usually are more appealing to the masses as "modern" designs typically look more aesthetically pleasing to today's society.
